## Contributing to the Unofficial Fable Patch

The following guidelines for contributing are outlined in the spirit of maintaining a minimal patch that fixes bugs while maintaining a consistent player experience. To do that, we must define what a bug is in this context, and what bug fixes are appropriate to include in this patch.

### Unofficial Fable Patch philosophy

 - This patch should be easy for any user to install, regardless of background and familiarity with the Fable modding ecosystem.
 - All changes are to be entirely 'unopinionated,' meaning they should not assert noticeable changes in gameplay, balance, or appearance that is unique from the intent of the original developers.
 - If a bug can be fixed via a user-noticeable 'workaround' that does not directly address the bug itself, then it should not be considered a fix and should be distributed separately from the patch.
 - Community feedback should always be valued and prioritised.
 - All documentation should be clear and easy to understand for both end users and mod developers.
