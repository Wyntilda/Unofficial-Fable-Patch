1.1 CHANGELOG

game.bin: 1968 GROUND_POPPYS
CoverValue: 1 to 0 (float)
- Removes poppy CoverValue. The current implementation of CoverValue is broken 
  and allows hiding in plain sight, and can even result in dropped fines.
- Additionally, this is also to remain consistent with the upcoming Unofficial 
  Fable Anniversary Patch, where it is removed due to visual flora 
  inconsistencies between the LEV and the UE3 landscape data.
- This may make a balanced return in the future.

game.bin: 11280 CTeleporterDef
Radius: 1 to 2 (float)
- Increases the teleporter radius of the Guild teleporter to be consistent 
  with other teleporter markers, as well as the radius of the experience 
  pedestal opposite the teleporter in the Guild.

game.bin: 14559 CObjectAugmentationsDef
NumberOfSlots: 5 to 4 (int)
- Decreases the number of augmentation slots in the Frying Pan to remain 
  consistent with the maximum number that the augmentation interface normally 
  allows.

FinalAlbion.wad: HeroGuildComplexInside.tng
Line 13437: PositionX lowered from 66.711426 to 66.619141
- Lowers the placement of the Guild teleport pedestal to make it level with 
  the ground leading into the teleporter's area and also consistent with the 
  levelling of the experience pedestal.

game.bin: 2518 DEFAULT_GLOBAL_DEFS
AgeIncreasePerLevelUp: 0.7 to 0.39 (float)
- Modified age increase per level up so that Hero does not reach max age until
  all skill level ups are purchased.

MaxExtraMaxHitPoints: 60 to 105 (float)
MaxExtraMaxStaminaPoints: 2000 to 2400 (int)

  usable Elixirs.

- Modified NW Balverine armour entry to match its intended armour.

game.bin: 2657 INVENTORY_CATEGORY_MELEE_WEAPONS
NumberOfSlots: 55 to 68 (int)
- Modified number of melee weapon slots to match maximum number of obtainable
  weapons, including those obtainable via unintended means such as Hero Save
  exploits or picking up Bandit weapons.

FinalAlbion.wad: FrescoDome.tng
OBJECT_SWORD_OF_AEONS moved to end of Q_EndGameBossBattle section (line 13076)
- Associated the Sword of Aeons in the Chamber of Fate with its intended quest
  script, so that it is only loaded during Battle Jack of Blades.
